Data Analytics: Predicting Customer Preferences 2020

Are the skills in this course applicable to data mining tasks in general?
Yes! The methods that you will use in this course have wide applicability to the data mining tasks you will encounter in nearly all business sectors and other real-world applications. The skills practiced in this course represent current professional practice and include:

Applying data mining in e-commerce (e.g. profitability prediction, customer segmentation, product selection strategy)
Preprocessing data for data mining (e.g., applying filters, addressing missing data)
Using data mining tools and different classifiers (e.g., k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, support vector machines) to develop predictive models
Using the R statistical programming language
Using the caret package for R
Applying machine learning techniques to classification and regression problems
Optimizing classifiers by adjusting and testing classifier parameters
Applying cross-validation methods
Assessing the predictive performance of classifiers by examining key error metrics
Comparing and selecting different predictive models
Applying predictive models to test sets
Presenting data mining results to management.
How does this course build on what I learned in the Data Analytics for Retail: Understanding Customers course?
In the Understanding Customers, you employed data analytics techniques to explore the structure of customer data to infer the buying patterns. In this course, you will explore the patterns in the data to create models to predict new events, like customer product preferences. You will also deepen your experience with machine-learning algorithms. Unlike the previous course, where you used algorithms out of the box, this course will teach you to optimize the initial performance of a classifier by adjusting its parameters. Finally, this course will build on the experience you had in the previous course of interpreting the output of a classifier by enabling you to use that interpretation to select from different classifiers to compare their performance characteristics.
